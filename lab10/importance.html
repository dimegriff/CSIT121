    <h2>Why Web Authentication is Important</h2>
    <p>
      Web Authentication addresses one of the biggest weaknesses in online security: passwords. Passwords are often reused, easy to guess, or stolen through phishing attacks. WebAuthn solves this by using more secure methods that rely on devices or biometrics instead of memorized words. This reduces the chances of accounts being hacked due to weak or compromised credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason WebAuthn is so important is its convenience. It allows people to log into sites quickly using a fingerprint, face scan, or a physical security key. Users no longer have to remember long, complex passwords for every site they visit. This makes online experiences both safer and easier, especially for people who aren’t very tech-savvy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, WebAuthn helps build trust between users and websites. When users know their login process is secure and their information is protected, they are more likely to engage with digital services. As identity theft and data breaches continue to rise, using a standard like WebAuthn shows that websites are serious about user safety and responsible development.
