    <h2>What is Web Authentication?</h2>
    <p>
      Web Authentication, often shortened to WebAuthn, is a web standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO Alliance. It is designed to allow users to log into websites and applications securely without using passwords. Instead, it uses methods like fingerprint scans, facial recognition, or physical security keys to confirm a user's identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This standard is built on public-key cryptography, meaning that users' login credentials never leave their device. When someone registers for a site using WebAuthn, their device creates a unique pair of keys—one public and one private. The website stores the public key, and the private key stays secure on the user’s device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web Authentication is supported by most modern browsers and operating systems. It provides a way to log in that’s not only more secure but also easier for users. Instead of remembering long, complex passwords, users can log in with something they have or are—like a USB key or a face scan. This is a major step forward in making the web safer.
