        <h1>Building Web Pages</h1>
    </header>

            This week was sort of a refresher to me when it came to HTML. I've had some
            experience with using HTML to build and format web pages and forums. I think 
            it is neat to see how much you can be specific about with tags and all that 
            you can do with basic html coding. Overall, this module was the perfect one to 
            help establish a foundation for me if I decide to build webpages.
