  <h1>Lab 06 - Website Evaluation</h1>

  <h2>What is the URL of the website?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals" target="_blank">https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals</a></p>

  <h2>What is the name of the website?</h2>
  <p>National Geographic Kids - Animals</p>

  <h2>Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
  <p>The target audience is children and young learners interested in animals and nature, as well as educators and parents who want educational content for kids.</p>

  <h2>How is the site organized?</h2>
  <p>The site is organized into animal categories and features individual pages for different species. It uses bright visuals, bold headings, and large clickable cards to guide young users through content. Navigation is mostly icon-based and scroll-driven.</p>

  <h2>Which CRAP Design Principle does the site use? Provide at least one example.</h2>
  <p><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses bright, high-contrast colors that help important content stand out against the background. For example, headings and buttons often use yellow on blue backgrounds to draw attention.</p>

  <h2>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/" target="_blank">AccessibilityChecker.org</a>, the site received a status of <strong>"Needs Improvement"</strong>. The report flagged several issues including missing image alternative text, contrast errors, and improperly labeled form elements. While many accessibility basics are covered, some improvements are needed to make the site fully inclusive.</p>

  <h2>What is the site's effectiveness?</h2>
  <p>The site effectively supports its users by offering engaging, age-appropriate animal facts. However, some content requires scrolling through long pages or hovering, which may be challenging for younger kids.</p>

  <h2>What is the site's efficiency?</h2>
  <p>The site is fairly efficient, with fast load times and visual tiles that help users choose what they want quickly. However, the homepage can feel cluttered, making it slightly harder to find specific animals without using the search.</p>

  <h2>How is the engagement?</h2>
  <p>The site is very engaging for children. It uses colorful graphics, animal photography, and fun facts to maintain interest. The interactive content (videos, quizzes) is appropriate for the topic and audience.</p>

  <h2>Screenshot of the Website</h2>

  <h2>Recommendation</h2>
  <p>I recommend improving contrast and adding descriptive alternative text to all images to enhance accessibility. Also, reducing homepage clutter would help young users focus better.</p>
