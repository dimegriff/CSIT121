<h2 id="lab02">Reflection - Lab 02</h2>
    <p>In Lab 02, I learned how to create and publish a basic HTML page. 
        Understanding file structure and hosting my work on different web servers gave me insight 
        into the process of making a webpage accessible online.</p>

   
    <h2 id="lab03">Reflection - Lab 03</h2>
    <p>In Lab 03, I explored CSS for styling my webpage. I learned about separating content from 
        design, applying styles with external stylesheets, and using different selectors to structure 
        my webpage visually.</p>


    <h2 id="lab05">Reflection - Lab 05</h2>
    <p>For Lab 05, I focused on responsive design principles. I learned how to use CSS Flexbox and 
        Grid to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Implementing media queries allowed 
        me to switch between a single-column mobile view and a multi-column desktop layout. One challenge 
        was ensuring that my page remained user-friendly across devices, but adjusting font sizes and 
        spacing helped. This lab reinforced the importance of designing for accessibility and usability, 
        making the web more inclusive for all users.</p>
